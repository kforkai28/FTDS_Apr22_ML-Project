## FTDS_Apr22_ML-Project

This was our (Indra, Max and my) Machine Learning project submission as part of our Full Time Data Science bootcamp. 

We had participated in a Kaggle competition and documented our progress and results. See enclosed .pdf to follow our journey.


Workflow:

We centralized EDA and feature engineering on one notebook, EDA_Master Ver, which then output csv files, df_train and df_test, which we used to conduct individual ML experimentation; Final results were consolidated into XGB_Model_final
